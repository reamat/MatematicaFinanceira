%%% What is \bmlCrop?
% template-sans-large.tex uses \input{template.tex} to read this file.
% Before that, it defines \bmlCrop, so that the above code imports crop.
% It also uses \PassOptionsToPackage to tweak the options of crop.
% The result has identical pagination as the normal PDF so you do not need
% to review both versions.
%
% However, the magnification is very limited. If you need larger magnification,
% you may have to use a larger font, in which case the large print PDF will
% will look different and must be reviewed regularly.
